# Manage messages and code snippets in Assistant

Assistant lets you manage messages and handle code snippets.

## Manage messages

Use the **Copy message** icon to copy Assistant's response text to your clipboard. For the response you want to copy, select **Copy message**, and paste the copied text into your desired application (for example, a text editor, email, or document).

> [!NOTE]
> When you copy responses, Assistant adds comments to indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) generated the text.

## Manage code snippets

When you request code snippets from Assistant, the code appears in a code block with two icons: **Save Code** and **Copy Code**. These features simplify how you use the code within your projects.

To save a code snippet in a folder, select **Save Code**, then **Save**.

To copy the code snippet to clipboard, select **Copy Code** and paste the code into your script.
